## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a **Bank Customer Churn Dataset** using tools such as **Excel**, **Pivot Tables**, **Data Analysis ToolPak**, and foundational data-cleaning techniques.  
The goal is to understand customer behavior and uncover factors that contribute to **customer churn**, while practicing real-world analytical workflows.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about **500 bank customers**. It includes demographic details, account behaviors, and churn indicators.

| Variable | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CustomerID** | Unique identifier for each customer |
| **Surname** | Customer's last name |
| **CreditScore** | Creditworthiness score (350–850) |
| **Geography** | Country/region (France, Spain, Germany) |
| **Gender** | Male or Female |
| **Age** | Customer age |
| **Tenure** | Number of years with the bank |
| **Balance** | Bank account balance |
| **NumOfProducts** | Number of banking products used |
| **HasCrCard** | Credit card ownership (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| **IsActiveMember** | Activity status (1 = Active, 0 = Inactive) |
| **EstimatedSalary** | Estimated annual income |
| **Churn** | Customer exit status (1 = Yes/Exited, 0 = No/Stayed) |

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

Your main task is to analyze the dataset and gain insights into **customer churn** using **Excel Pivot Tables** and **Data Analysis ToolPak**.

You will:

- Clean the dataset (handle missing & inconsistent values)
- Build Pivot Tables to answer analytical questions
- Perform statistical tests using Data Analysis ToolPak
- Summarize insights and findings

---

## 🧮 Analytical Questions (Using Pivot Tables in Excel)

Create a Pivot Table for each question and summarize your insights:

1. **What is the average credit score for each geography?**
2. **How does the average account balance vary between genders within each country?**
3. **What is the distribution of active vs. non-active members by credit card ownership?**
4. **What is the customer churn rate per number of products used?**
5. **What is the average credit score for customers who exited vs. stayed, across different tenure levels?**

---

## 🔬 Research Questions (Using Data Analysis ToolPak – Significance Level 0.05)

Create a separate worksheet for each:

1. **Is there a significant difference in average earnings (EstimatedSalary) between churned and non-churned customers?**
2. **Is there a significant difference in average credit scores among customers from different geographic locations?**

_Assume no normality testing is required (ToolPak handles computation only)._

## 🛠️ Instructions

### **Data Cleaning Requirements**
- Identify missing values in `EstimatedSalary`  
- Identify inconsistent entries in `Balance`  
- Replace missing or incorrect values using **average values**  
- Ensure all variables are properly formatted for analysis  

### **Excel Workflow**
1. Build **5 Pivot Tables** for analytical questions  
2. Build **2 ToolPak tests** (t-test and ANOVA) for research questions  
3. Add a short interpretation section for each answer  
4. Use clean formatting and readable labels  

---

## ❓ Assignment Questions (to answer in your submission)

Use your cleaned dataset and Excel results to answer:

1. **How many missing values are in the "EstimatedSalary" variable?**  
2. **What is the average balance (after removing inconsistent values)?**  
3. **What is the average credit score of customers from Germany?**  
4. **What is the average bank balance of male customers from France?**  
5. **How many customers churned among those with a credit card?**  
6. **How many customers stayed among those who used 3 products?**  
7. **What is the average credit score for a churned customer with a tenure of 1 year?**  
8. **What is the average salary of churned customers?**  
9. **What is your conclusion for Research Question 1**  
   _(Salary difference between churn vs. not churn)_  
10. **What is your conclusion for Research Question 2**  
    _(Credit score difference across geography)_
